Here is the git repository for project_06:
https://github.com/MadViper/nand2tetris-starter-py 
for project_06 all you need to modify is these two files:
n2t/core/assembler/facade.py - here goes the logic.
n2t/tests/e2e/test_assemble.py - you should comment this line : # @pytest.mark.skip 
to not skip the assembler tests.

Its a must that you run it with python 3.11 version, otherwise it wont work
